# Covered Put


# 涵盖的投入
Writing covered puts is a bearish options trading strategy involving the writing of put options while shorting the obligated shares of the underlying stock.

写入保证金是一种看跌期权交易策略，涉及卖出看跌期权，同时卖空标的股票的义务股。
## Limited profits with no downside risk


## 利润有限，没有下行风险
Profit for the covered put option strategy is limited and maximum gain is equal to the premiums received for the options sold.

承保期权策略的利润是有限的，最大收益等于所售出期权的收益。
The formula for calculating maximum profit is given below:

计算最大利润的公式如下：
## Unlimited upside risk


## 无限的上行风险
As the writer is short on the stock, he is subjected to much risk if the price of the underlying stock rises dramatically. In theory, maximum loss for the covered    put options strategy is unlimited since there is no limit to how high the stock price can be at expiration. If    applicable, the covered put writer will also have to payout any dividends.

由于作者缺乏股票，如果底层股票的价格急剧上涨，他将面临很大的风险。
The formula for calculating loss is given below:

计算损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the covered put position can be calculated using the following formula.

可以使用以下公式计算覆盖放置位置实现收支平衡的低价格。
## Example


## 例
Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $45 in June. An options trader writes a covered    put by selling a JUL 45 put for $200 while shorting 100 shares of XYZ stock. The net credit taken to enter the    position is $200, which is also his maximum possible    profit.

假设XYZ股票6月交易价格为45美元。
On expiration in July, XYZ stock is still trading at $45. The JUL 45 put expires        worthless while the trader covers his short position with no loss. In the end, he        gets to keep the entire credit taken as profit.

在7月到期时，XYZ股票的交易价仍为45美元。 
        If instead XYZ stock drops to $40 on expiration, the short put will expire in the        money and is worth $500 but this loss is offset by the $500 gain in the short stock        position. Thus, the profit is still the initial credit of $200 taken on entering        the trade.

如果XYZ股票在到期时下跌至40美元，那么空头看跌期权将在货币到期并且价值500美元，但这一损失被短期股票头寸的500美元收益所抵消。
However, should the stock rally to $55 on expiration, a significant loss results.        At this price, the short stock position taken when XYZ stock was trading at $45        suffers a $1000 loss. Subtracting the initial credit of $200 taken, the resulting loss is $800.

但是，如果股票在到期时反弹至55美元，则会出现重大损失。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the covered put is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注：尽管我们已参考股票期权涵盖了此策略的使用，但涵盖看跌期权同样适用于ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Naked Call Writing


## 裸体电话写作
An alternative but similar strategy to writing covered puts is to         write naked calls. Naked call writing has the same profit potential as the covered put write but is executed using call options instead.

编写覆盖推文的另一种但类似的策略是编写裸调用。
