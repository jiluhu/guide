# Call Backspread


# 致电Backspread
The call backspread (reverse call ratio spread) is a bullish strategy in options trading that involves selling a number of call options    and buying more call options    of the same underlying stock and expiration date    at a higher strike price. It is an unlimited profit, limited risk options trading strategy that is taken when    the options trader thinks that the underlying stock will experience significant upside movement in the near term.

看涨期权（反向看涨期权差价）是期权交易中的看涨策略，涉及卖出多个看涨期权并购买相同底层股票的更多看涨期权和更高执行价格的到期日。
    A 2:1 call backspread can be implemented by selling a number of calls    at a lower strike and buying twice the number of calls at a higher strike.

可以通过在较低的罢工时出售多个电话并在较高的罢工中购买两倍的电话来实现2：1的电话延期。
## Unlimited Profit Potential


## 无限的利润潜力
        The call back spread profits when the stock price makes a strong move to the upside beyond the upper breakeven point. There is no limit to the maximum possible profit.

当股票价格强势上涨超过盈亏平衡点以上时，回调利润就会扩散。
The formula for calculating profit is given below:

计算利润的公式如下：
## Limited Risk


## 风险有限
    Maximum loss for the call back spread is limited and is taken when the underlying stock price at expiration    is at the strike price of the long calls purchased. At this price, both the long calls        expire worthless while the short call expires in the money. Maximum loss is         equal to the intrinsic value        of the short call plus or minus any debit or credit taken when putting on the spread.

回拨差价的最大损失是有限的，并且当到期的标的股票价格是所购买的长期看涨期权的执行价格时采取。
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

计算最大损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
There are 2 break-even points for the call backspread position. The breakeven points can be calculated using the following formulae.

呼叫延迟位置有2个收支平衡点。
## Example


## 例
Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $43 in June. An options trader executes a 2:1 call    backspread by selling a JUL 40 call for $400 and buying two JUL 45 calls for $200 each. The net debit/credit taken to enter the trade is zero.

假设XYZ股票6月交易价格为43美元。
        On expiration in July, if XYZ stock is trading at $45, both the JUL 45 calls expire        worthless while the short JUL 40 call expires in the money with $500 in intrinsic        value. Buying back this call to close the position will result in the maximum loss        of $500 for the options trader.

在7月到期时，如果XYZ股票的交易价格为45美元，那么JUL 45的看涨期权到期都将毫无价值，而JUL 40的短期看涨期权将以500美元的内在价值到期。
        If XYZ stock rallies and is trading at $50 on expiration in July, all the options        will expire in the money. The short JUL 40 call is worth $1000 and needs to be bought        back to close the position. Since the two JUL 45 call bought is now worth $500 each,        their combined value of $1000 is just enough to offset the losses from the written call. Therefore,        he achieves breakeven at $50.    

如果XYZ股票在7月到期时反弹并且交易价格为50美元，则所有期权都将在到期时到期。
        Beyond $50 though, there will be no limit to the gains possible. For example, at        $60, each long JUL 45 call will be worth $1500 while his single short JUL 40 call        is only worth $2000, resulting in a profit of $1000.    

超过50美元，对可能的收益没有限制。
        If the stock price had dropped        to $40 or below at expiration, all the options involved will expire worthless. Since        the net debit to put on this trade is zero, there is no resulting loss.

如果股票价格在到期时降至40美元或以下，所有相关选项将失效。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the call backspread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注意：虽然我们已经参考股票期权涵盖了这一策略的使用，但是使用ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权，回拨扩展同样适用。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Similar Strategies


## 类似的策略
The following strategies are similar to the call backspread in that they are also bullish strategies that have unlimited profit potential and limited risk.

以下策略类似于延迟回拨，因为它们也是看涨策略，具有无限的盈利潜力和有限的风险。
## Ratio Spread


## 比率差价
The converse strategy to the backspread is the ratio spread.         Ratio spreads    are used when little movement is expected of    the underlying stock price.

延迟的逆向策略是比率差价。
## Put Backspread


## 放回延展
The backspread can also be constructed using puts. Unlike the call backspread,    the put backspread is a bearish strategy.

背衬也可以使用推杆构造。
