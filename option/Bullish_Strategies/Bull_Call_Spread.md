# Bull Call Spread


# 公牛呼叫传播
The bull call spread option trading strategy is employed when the options trader thinks that the price of        the underlying asset will go up moderately in the near term.

当期权交易者认为相关资产的价格在短期内适度上涨时，采用看涨期权差价交易策略。
Bull call spreads can be        implemented by buying an at-the-money call option while simultaneously writing a higher striking out-of-the-money call option of the same underlying security and the same expiration month.

可以通过购买价内看涨期权来实现公牛看涨期权，同时写入相同基础证券和相同到期月份的更高价的看涨期权看涨期权。
        By shorting the out-of-the-money        call, the options trader reduces the cost of establishing the bullish position but        forgoes the chance of making a large profit in the event that the underlying asset        price skyrockets. The bull call spread option strategy is also known as the bull call debit spread as a debit is taken upon entering the trade.    

通过卖空价外看涨期权，期权交易者降低了建立看涨头寸的成本，但放弃了在相关资产价格飙升的情况下赚取大量利润的机会。
## Limited Upside profits


## 有限的上升利润
Maximum gain is reached for the bull call spread options strategy when the stock price move above the higher strike price of    the two calls and it is equal to the difference between the strike price of the    two call options minus the initial debit taken to enter the position.

当股票价格移动到两个看涨期权的较高执行价格之上并且它等于两个看涨期权的执行价格减去进入头寸所需的初始借记之间的差额时，达到牛市看涨期权策略的最大收益
The formula for calculating maximum profit is given below:

计算最大利润的公式如下：
## Limited Downside risk


## 下行风险有限
The bull call spread strategy will result in a loss if the stock price declines at expiration. Maximum    loss cannot be more than the initial debit taken to enter the spread position.

如果股票价格在到期时下跌，则看涨期权差价策略将导致亏损。
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

计算最大损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the bull call spread position can be calculated using the following formula.

可以使用以下公式计算公牛呼叫扩散位置实现收支平衡的低价格价格。
## Bull Call Spread Example


## Bull Call Spread示例
An options trader believes that XYZ stock trading at $42 is going to rally soon        and enters a bull call spread by buying a JUL 40 call for $300 and writing a JUL        45 call for $100. The net investment required to put on the spread is a debit of $200.

期权交易商认为，42美元的XYZ股票交易将很快反弹，并以300美元的价格购买7月的JUL 40并以100美元的价格收购JUL 45。
        The stock price of XYZ begins to rise and closes at $46 on expiration date. Both        options expire in-the-money with the JUL 40 call having an             intrinsic value of $600        and the JUL 45 call having an intrinsic value of $100. This means that the spread        is now worth $500 at expiration. Since the trader had a debit of $200 when he bought        the spread, his net profit is $300.

XYZ的股票价格在到期日开始上涨并收于46美元。
        If the price of XYZ had declined to $38 instead, both options expire worthless.        The trader will lose his entire investment of $200, which is also his maximum possible        loss.

如果XYZ的价格下降到38美元，两种选择都将失效。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the bull call spread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注意：尽管我们已参考股票期权涵盖了此策略的使用，但公牛看涨期权同样适用于ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Similar Strategies


## 类似的策略
The following strategies are similar to the bull call spread in that they are also bullish strategies that have limited profit potential and limited risk.

以下策略类似于看涨期权差价，因为它们也是利多潜力有限且风险有限的看涨策略。
## Aggressive Bull Call Spread


## 激进的公牛呼叫传播
        One can enter a more aggressive bull spread position by widening the difference        between the strike price of the two call options. However, this will also mean that        the stock price must move upwards by a greater degree for the trader to realise        the maximum profit.\xc2\xa0

通过扩大两个看涨期权的执行价格之间的差异，可以进入更积极的牛市价差头寸。
## Bull Spread on a Credit


## 公牛信贷利差
The bull call spread is a debit spread as the difference between the sale and purchase of the two options results in a net debit. For a bullish spread position that is entered with a net credit, see bull put spread.

公牛电话差价是借方差价，因为两个期权的买卖之间的差异导致净借记。
