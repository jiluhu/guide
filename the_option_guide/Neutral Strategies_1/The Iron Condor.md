# Iron Condors
The iron condor is a limited risk, non-directional option trading strategy that is designed to have a large probability of earning a small limited profit when the underlying security is perceived to have low volatility. The iron condor strategy can also be visualized as a combination of a bull put spread and a bear call spread.
Using options expiring on the same expiration month, the option trader creates an iron condor by selling a lower strike             out-of-the-money put, buying an even lower strike out-of-the-money put, selling        a higher strike out-of-the-money call        and buying another even higher strike out-of-the-money call. This results in a net credit to put on the trade.

## Limited Profit
Maximum gain for the iron condor strategy is equal to the net credit received when entering the trade. Maximum    profit is attained when the underlying stock price at expiration is between the    strikes of the call and put sold. At this price, all the options expire worthless.
The formula for calculating maximum profit is given below:

## Limited Risk
Maximum loss for the iron condor spread is also limited but significantly higher than the maximum profit. It    occurs when the stock price falls at or below the lower strike of the put purchased    or rise above or equal to the higher strike of the call purchased. In either situation,    maximum loss is equal to the difference in strike between the calls (or puts) minus    the net credit received when entering the trade.
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

## Breakeven Point(s)
There are 2 break-even points for the iron condor position. The breakeven points can be calculated using the following formulae.

## Example
    Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $45 in June. An options trader executes an iron    condor by buying a JUL 35 put for $50, writing a JUL 40 put for $100, writing another    JUL 50 call for $100 and buying another JUL 55 call for $50. The net credit received    when entering the trade is $100, which is also his maximum possible profit.
        On expiration in July, XYZ stock is still trading at $45. All the 4 options expire worthless and the options trader gets to keep the entire credit received as profit.        This is also his maximum possible profit.    
        If XYZ stock is instead trading at $35 on expiration, all the options except the        JUL 40 put sold expire worthless. The JUL 40 put has an intrinsic value        of $500.        This option has to be bought back to exit the trade. Thus, subtracting his initial        $100 credit received, the options        trader suffers his maximum possible loss of $400.        This maximum loss situation also occurs if the stock price had gone up to $55 instead.    
        To further see why $400 is the maximum possible loss, lets examine what happens        when the stock price falls to $30 on expiration. At this price, both the JUL 35        put and the JUL 40 put options expire in-the-money. The long JUL 35 put has an intrinsic        value of $500 while the short JUL 40 put is worth $1000. Selling the long put for        $500, he still need $500 to buy back the short put. Subtracting the initial credit        of $100 received, his loss is still $400.
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the iron condor is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

## Commissions
Commission charges can make a significant impact to overall profit or loss when implementing option spreads strategies. Their effect is even more pronounced for the iron condor as there are 4 legs involved in this trade compared to simpler strategies like the vertical spreads which have only 2 legs.
If you make multi-legged options trades frequently, you should check out the brokerage firm OptionsHouse.com where they charge a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade). 

## Similar Strategies
The following strategies are similar to the iron condor in that they are also low volatility strategies that have limited profit potential and limited risk.

## The Reverse Iron Condor
The converse strategy to the iron condor is the reverse or short iron condor. Short iron condors are used when one perceives the volatility of the price of the underlying    stock to be high.

## Wingspreads
The iron condor spread belongs to a family of spreads called         wingspreads whose members are named after a myriad of flying creatures.
