# Options Arbitrage
In the options market, arbitrage trades are often performed by firm or floor traders    to earn small profits with little or no risk. To setup an arbitrage, the options trader would go long on an underpriced position and sell the equivalent overpriced    position. 
        If puts are overpriced relative to calls, the arbitrager would sell a naked put        and offset it by buying a synthetic put. Similarly, when calls are        overpriced in relation to puts, one would sell a naked call and buy a synthetic call. The use of                 synthetic positions are common in options arbitrage strategies.\xc2\xa0
        The opportunity for arbitrage in options trading rarely exist for individual investors        as price discrepancies often appear only for a few moments. However, an important        lesson to learn    from here is that the actions by floor traders doing reversals and        conversions quickly restore the market to equilibrium, keeping the price of calls        and puts in line, establishing what is known as the put-call            parity.

##         Conversion and Reversal
        Floor traders perform conversions when options are        overpriced relative to the underlying asset. When the options are relatively underpriced,        traders will do reverse conversions, otherwise known as reversals.

##         Box Spread
        Another common arbitrage strategy in options trading is the             box spread where equivalent vertical spread positions are bought and sold        for a riskless profit.\xc2\xa0

## Dividend Arbitrage
Besides conversions, reversals and boxes, there is also the             dividend arbitrage strategy which attempts to capture a stock's dividend payout with        no risk.
