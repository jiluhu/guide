# Dividend Arbitrage
This is an arbitrage strategy whereby the options trader buys both the stock and    the equivalent number of put options before         ex-dividend and wait to collect the dividend before exercising    his put.

## Example
XYZ stock is trading at $90 and is paying $2 in dividend tomorrow. A put with a        striking    price of $100 is selling for $11. The options trader can enter a riskless        dividend arbitrage by purchasing both the stock for $9000 and the put for $1100        for a total of $10100.    
On ex-dividend, he collects $200 in the form of dividends and exercises his put to sell his stock for $10000,        bringing in a total of $10200. Since his initial investment is only $10100, he earns        $100 in zero risk profits.

## Dividend Capturing using Covered Writes
        Another way to collect dividends is by using covered calls. This strategy is detailed        in this article.
