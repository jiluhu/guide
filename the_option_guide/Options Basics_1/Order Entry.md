# Order Entry
        Since this is a basic introduction to options trading, we will be focusing on executing        simple orders that just involve buying options.
        From the options chain screen, you will have selected the option you wish to purchase        by clicking on the options symbol. A separate order entry screen will be displayed        and here, you have several things to specify to complete your order.

###         Quantity
        After confirming the underlying security, expiration month and the strike price,        the first thing you need to specify is the quantity. For options, this is the number        of contracts you wish to buy. Remember, for stock options, each contract covers 100        shares. Commissions are charged for every contract but many brokerages offer discounts        for larger orders. Sometimes, depending on your broker, there is also        a mimimum commission        charge for every order.

###         All or None
        This option is available for limit orders. If you select this option, your broker        will try to fill all of the quantity you specified. If he is unable to do that,        then none of your orders will be filled.
