# Synthetic Short Stock
The synthetic short stock is an options strategy used to simulate the payoff of a short    stock position. It is entered by selling at-the-moneycalls and buying an equal number of at-the-money    puts of the same underlying stock and expiration date. 
This is an unlimited profit, unlimited risk options trading strategy that is taken when    the options trader is bearish on the underlying security but seeks an alternative        to short selling the stock.

## Unlimited Profit Potential
Similar to a short stock position, there is no maximum profit for the synthetic    short stock. The options trader    stands to profit as long as the underlying stock price goes down.
Additionally, a credit is usually taken when entering this position since calls are        generally more expensive than puts. Hence, even if the underlying stock price remains        unchanged on expiration date, there will still be a profit equal to the        initial credit taken.
The formula for calculating profit is given below:

## Unlimited Risk
Like the short stock position, heavy losses can occur for the synthetic short stock    if the underlying stock price    shoots upwards.
The formula for calculating loss is given below:

## Breakeven Point(s)
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the synthetic short stock position can be calculated using the following formula.

## Example
Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $40 in June. An options trader setups a synthetic    short stock by buying a JUL 40 put for $100 and selling a JUL 40 call for $150. The net credit taken to enter the trade is $50.
        If XYZ stock rallies and is trading at $50 on expiration in July, the long JUL 40        put will expire worthless but the short JUL 40 call expires in the money and has an intrinsic value        of $1000.         Buying back this short call will require $1000 and subtracting the        initial $50 credit taken when entering the trade, the trader's loss comes to $950. Comparatively, this is very close to the loss of $1000 for a short        stock position.
On expiration in July, if XYZ stock is instead trading at $30, the short JUL 40 call will        expire worthless while the long JUL 40 put will expire in the money and be worth $1000.        Including the initial $50 credit taken, the trader's profit comes to $1050. This amount        closely approximates the $1000 gain of the corresponding short stock position.

## Commissions
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

## Advantages vs Short Stock
Three important reasons make the synthetic short stock strategy superior to actual        short selling of the underlying stock. Firstly, there is no need to borrow stock        to short sell. Secondly, there is no need to wait for the uptick, thus transactions        are more timely. Finally, there is no        need to pay dividends on the short stock (if        the underlying security is a dividend paying stock).    

##  Synthetic Short Stock (Split Strikes)
There is a more aggressive version of this strategy where both the call and put    options involved are out-of-the-money. While    a larger downside movement of the underlying stock price is required to make large    profits, this split strikes strategy    does provide more room for error.

## Synthetic Long Stock
The converse strategy to the synthetic short stock is the         synthetic long stock, which is used when the options trader is bullish on    the underlying but seeks an alternative to purchasing the stock itself.
