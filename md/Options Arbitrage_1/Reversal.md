# Reversal
A reversal, or reverse conversion, is an arbitrage strategy in options trading that can be performed for    a riskless profit when options are underpriced relative to the         underlying stock.    To do a reversal, the trader short sell the underlying stock and offset it with an equivalent     synthetic long stock (long call + short put) position.

## Limited Risk-free Profit
        Profit is locked in immediately when the reversal is done and it can be calculated        using the following formula:
Profit = Sale Price of Underlying - Strike Price of Call/Put + Put Premium            - Call Premium

## Example
        Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $100 in June and the JUL 100 call is priced at $3        while the JUL 100 put is priced at $4. An arbitrage trader does a reversal by short        selling 100 shares of XYZ for $10000 while simultaneously buying a JUL 100 call        for $300 and selling a JUL 100 put for $400. An initial credit of $10100 is received        when entering the trade.
        If XYZ stock rallies to $110 in July, the short JUL 100 put will expire worthless        while the long JUL 100 call expires in the money and is exercised to cover the short        stock position for $10000. Since the initial credit received was $10100, the trader        ends up with a net profit of $100.\xc2\xa0
        If instead XYZ stock had dropped to $90 in July, the long JUL 100 call will expire        worthless while the short JUL 100 put expires in the money and is assigned. The trader then buys back the obligated quantity of stock for $10000 to cover his short        stock position, again netting a profit of $100.    
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the reversal is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

## Commissions
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

## Conversion
If the options are relatively overpriced, the conversion            is used instead to perform        the arbitrage trade.
