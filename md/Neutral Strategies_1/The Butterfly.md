# Butterfly Spread
The butterfly spread is a neutral strategy that is a combination of a bull spread and a bear spread. It is a limited profit, limited risk options strategy. There are 3 striking prices involved in a butterfly spread and it can be constructed using calls or     puts.

## Long Call Butterfly
Long butterfly spreads are entered when the investor thinks that the         underlying stock will not rise or fall much by expiration. Using calls, the long butterfly can be constructed by buying one lower striking         in-the-money call, writing two at-the-money    calls and buying another higher striking out-of-the-money        call. A resulting net debit is taken to enter the trade.

## Limited Profit
Maximum profit for the long butterfly spread is attained when the underlying stock price remains unchanged at expiration. At this price, only the lower striking call expires in the money. 
The formula for calculating maximum profit is given below:

## Limited Risk
Maximum loss for the long butterfly spread is limited to the initial debit taken to enter the trade plus commissions.
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

## Breakeven Point(s)
There are 2 break-even points for the butterfly spread position. The breakeven points can be calculated using the following formulae.

## Example
    Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $40 in June. An options trader executes a long call    butterfly by purchasing a JUL 30 call for $1100, writing two JUL 40 calls for $400    each and purchasing another JUL 50 call for $100. The net debit taken to enter the    position is $400, which is also his maximum possible loss.
        On expiration in July, XYZ stock is still trading at $40. The JUL 40 calls and the        JUL 50 call expire worthless while the JUL 30 call still has an intrinsic value        of $1000. Subtracting the initial debit of $400, the resulting profit is $600, which        is also the maximum profit attainable.
        Maximum loss results when the stock is trading below $30 or above $50. At $30, all        the options expires worthless. Above $50, any "profit" from the two long calls will        be neutralised by the "loss" from the two short calls. In both situations, the butterfly        trader suffers maximum loss which is the initial debit taken to enter the trade.
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the butterfly spread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

## Commissions
Commission charges can make a significant impact to overall profit or loss when implementing option spreads strategies. Their effect is even more pronounced for the butterfly spread as there are 4 legs involved in this trade compared to simpler strategies like the vertical spreads which have only 2 legs.
If you make multi-legged options trades frequently, you should check out the brokerage firm OptionsHouse.com where they charge a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade). 

## Similar Strategies
The following strategies are similar to the butterfly spread in that they are also low volatility strategies that have limited profit potential and limited risk.

## Short Butterfly
The converse strategy to the long butterfly is the short butterfly. Short butterfly    spreads are used when high volatility is expected to push the stock price in either    direction.

## Long Put Butterfly
The long butterfly trading strategy can also be created using puts instead of calls and is known as a long put butterfly.

## Wingspreads
The butterfly spread belongs to a family of spreads called         wingspreads whose members are named after a myriad of flying creatures.
