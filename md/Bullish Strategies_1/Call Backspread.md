# Call Backspread
The call backspread (reverse call ratio spread) is a bullish strategy in options trading that involves selling a number of call options    and buying more call options    of the same underlying stock and expiration date    at a higher strike price. It is an unlimited profit, limited risk options trading strategy that is taken when    the options trader thinks that the underlying stock will experience significant upside movement in the near term.
    A 2:1 call backspread can be implemented by selling a number of calls    at a lower strike and buying twice the number of calls at a higher strike.

## Unlimited Profit Potential
        The call back spread profits when the stock price makes a strong move to the upside beyond the upper breakeven point. There is no limit to the maximum possible profit.
The formula for calculating profit is given below:

## Limited Risk
    Maximum loss for the call back spread is limited and is taken when the underlying stock price at expiration    is at the strike price of the long calls purchased. At this price, both the long calls        expire worthless while the short call expires in the money. Maximum loss is         equal to the intrinsic value        of the short call plus or minus any debit or credit taken when putting on the spread.
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

## Breakeven Point(s)
There are 2 break-even points for the call backspread position. The breakeven points can be calculated using the following formulae.

## Example
Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $43 in June. An options trader executes a 2:1 call    backspread by selling a JUL 40 call for $400 and buying two JUL 45 calls for $200 each. The net debit/credit taken to enter the trade is zero.
        On expiration in July, if XYZ stock is trading at $45, both the JUL 45 calls expire        worthless while the short JUL 40 call expires in the money with $500 in intrinsic        value. Buying back this call to close the position will result in the maximum loss        of $500 for the options trader.
        If XYZ stock rallies and is trading at $50 on expiration in July, all the options        will expire in the money. The short JUL 40 call is worth $1000 and needs to be bought        back to close the position. Since the two JUL 45 call bought is now worth $500 each,        their combined value of $1000 is just enough to offset the losses from the written call. Therefore,        he achieves breakeven at $50.    
        Beyond $50 though, there will be no limit to the gains possible. For example, at        $60, each long JUL 45 call will be worth $1500 while his single short JUL 40 call        is only worth $2000, resulting in a profit of $1000.    
        If the stock price had dropped        to $40 or below at expiration, all the options involved will expire worthless. Since        the net debit to put on this trade is zero, there is no resulting loss.
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the call backspread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

## Commissions
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

## Similar Strategies
The following strategies are similar to the call backspread in that they are also bullish strategies that have unlimited profit potential and limited risk.

## Ratio Spread
The converse strategy to the backspread is the ratio spread.         Ratio spreads    are used when little movement is expected of    the underlying stock price.

## Put Backspread
The backspread can also be constructed using puts. Unlike the call backspread,    the put backspread is a bearish strategy.
