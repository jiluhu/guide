# Bull Call Spread
The bull call spread option trading strategy is employed when the options trader thinks that the price of        the underlying asset will go up moderately in the near term.
Bull call spreads can be        implemented by buying an at-the-money call option while simultaneously writing a higher striking out-of-the-money call option of the same underlying security and the same expiration month.
        By shorting the out-of-the-money        call, the options trader reduces the cost of establishing the bullish position but        forgoes the chance of making a large profit in the event that the underlying asset        price skyrockets. The bull call spread option strategy is also known as the bull call debit spread as a debit is taken upon entering the trade.    

## Limited Upside profits
Maximum gain is reached for the bull call spread options strategy when the stock price move above the higher strike price of    the two calls and it is equal to the difference between the strike price of the    two call options minus the initial debit taken to enter the position.
The formula for calculating maximum profit is given below:

## Limited Downside risk
The bull call spread strategy will result in a loss if the stock price declines at expiration. Maximum    loss cannot be more than the initial debit taken to enter the spread position.
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

## Breakeven Point(s)
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the bull call spread position can be calculated using the following formula.

## Bull Call Spread Example
An options trader believes that XYZ stock trading at $42 is going to rally soon        and enters a bull call spread by buying a JUL 40 call for $300 and writing a JUL        45 call for $100. The net investment required to put on the spread is a debit of $200.
        The stock price of XYZ begins to rise and closes at $46 on expiration date. Both        options expire in-the-money with the JUL 40 call having an             intrinsic value of $600        and the JUL 45 call having an intrinsic value of $100. This means that the spread        is now worth $500 at expiration. Since the trader had a debit of $200 when he bought        the spread, his net profit is $300.
        If the price of XYZ had declined to $38 instead, both options expire worthless.        The trader will lose his entire investment of $200, which is also his maximum possible        loss.
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the bull call spread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

## Commissions
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

## Similar Strategies
The following strategies are similar to the bull call spread in that they are also bullish strategies that have limited profit potential and limited risk.

## Aggressive Bull Call Spread
        One can enter a more aggressive bull spread position by widening the difference        between the strike price of the two call options. However, this will also mean that        the stock price must move upwards by a greater degree for the trader to realise        the maximum profit.\xc2\xa0

## Bull Spread on a Credit
The bull call spread is a debit spread as the difference between the sale and purchase of the two options results in a net debit. For a bullish spread position that is entered with a net credit, see bull put spread.
