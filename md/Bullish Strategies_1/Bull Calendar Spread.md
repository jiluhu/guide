# Bull Calendar Spread
 Using calls, the bull calendar spread strategy can be setup by buying long term        slightly out-of-the-money calls and simultaneously        writing an equal number of near month calls of the same             underlying security with the same strike price.    
        The options trader applying this strategy is bullish for the long term and is selling the near month        calls with the the intention to ride the long term calls for free.

## Unlimited Upside Profit Potential
        Once the near month options expire worthless, this strategy turns into a discounted        long call strategy and so the upside profit potential for the bull calendar spread becomes        unlimited.    

## Limited Downside Risk
The maximum possible loss for the bull calendar spread is limited to the initial debit taken to put on the spread.    This happens when the stock price goes down and stays down until expiration of the    longer term call.

## Example
        In June, an options trader believes that XYZ stock trading at $40 is going to rise        gradually over the next four months. He enters a bull calendar spread by buying        an OCT 45 out-of-the-money call for $200 and writing a JUL 45 out-of-the-money call for $100. The net investment required        to put on the spread is a debit of $100.
        In July, The stock price of XYZ goes up to $42 and the JUL 45 call expires worthless.        Subsequently, the price of XYZ stock rises to $49 in October. The OCT 45 call expires in the money and is worth $400 on expiration. Since the initial debit taken to enter        the trade is $100, his profit comes to $300.
        Suppose the price of XYZ did not rise much and remains at or below $45 all the way        until expiration of the long term call in October, the trader will lose the initial        debit of $100 as        both calls expire worthless.
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the bull calendar spread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

## Commissions
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

## Similar Strategies
The following strategies are similar to the bull calendar spread in that they are also bullish strategies that have limited profit potential and limited risk.

## Neutral Calendar Spread
        If the options trader is neutral on the underlying stock, he can instead        implement the neutral calendar spread strategy to sell the near        month calls primarily to profit from             time decay.
