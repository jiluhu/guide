# Long Call


# 长期通话
The long call option strategy is the most basic option trading strategy whereby the options trader buy call options with the belief that the price of the         underlying security will rise significantly beyond the strike price before the option expiration date.

长期看涨期权策略是最基本的期权交易策略，期权交易者买入看涨期权，相信基础证券的价格将在期权到期日之前大幅上涨超过行使价。
## Leverage


## 杠杆作用
 Compared to buying the underlying shares outright, the call option buyer is able        to gain leverage since the lower priced calls appreciate in value faster percentagewise        for every point rise in the price of the underlying stock

与直接购买标的股票相比，看涨期权买方能够获得杠杆，因为对于标的股票价格的每一个点上涨，较低价格的看涨期权价值会快速上升
However, call options have a limited lifespan. If the underlying stock price does not move above the strike price before the option expiration date, the call option will expire worthless.

但是，通话选项的使用寿命有限。
## Unlimited Profit Potential


## 无限的利润潜力
Since they can be no limit as to how high the stock price can be at expiration date, there is no limit to the maximum profit possible when implementing the long call option strategy.

由于它们对到期日股票价格的高度没有限制，因此在实施长期看涨期权策略时可能的最大利润没有限制。
The formula for calculating profit is given below:

计算利润的公式如下：
## Limited Risk


## 风险有限
Risk for the long call options strategy is limited to the price paid for the call option no matter how low the stock price is trading on expiration date.

长期看涨期权策略的风险仅限于为看涨期权支付的价格，无论股票价格在到期日交易的价格有多低。
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

计算最大损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the long call position can be calculated using the following formula.

可以使用以下公式计算长呼叫位置实现收支平衡的低价格。
## Example


## 例
Suppose the stock of XYZ company is trading at $40. A call option contract with a strike price of $40 expiring in a month's time is being priced at $2. You believe that XYZ stock will rise sharply in the coming weeks and so you paid $200 to purchase a single $40 XYZ call option covering 100 shares.

假设XYZ公司的股票交易价格为40美元。
Say you were proven right and the price of XYZ stock rallies to $50 on option expiration date. With underlying stock price at $50, if you were to exercise your call option, you invoke your right to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock at $40 each and can sell them immediately in the open market for $50 a share. This gives you a profit of $10 per share. As each call option contract covers 100 shares, the total amount you will receive from the exercise is $1000. Since you had paid $200 to purchase the call option, your net profit for the entire trade is therefore $800.

假设您被证明是正确的，并且XYZ股票的价格在期权到期日上涨至50美元。
However, if you were wrong in your assessement and the stock price had instead dived to $30, your call option will expire worthless and your total loss will be the $200 that you paid to purchase the option.

但是，如果您的评估错误并且股票价格已降至30美元，那么您的看涨期权将失效并且您的总损失将是您购买期权所支付的200美元。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the long call is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注意：尽管我们已参考股票期权涵盖了此策略的使用，但长期看涨期权同样适用于ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Similar Strategies


## 类似的策略
The following strategies are similar to the long call in that they are also bullish strategies that have unlimited profit potential and limited risk.

以下策略类似于长期看涨，因为它们也是看涨策略，具有无限的盈利潜力和有限的风险。
## Out-of-the-money Calls


## 价外的电话
Going long on out-of-the-money calls maybe cheaper but the call options have higher risk of expiring        worthless.

长期看到价外的电话可能会更便宜，但是看涨期权有更高的到期风险毫无价值。
## In-the-money Calls


## 价内通话
In-the-money calls are more expensive than out-of-the-money calls but less amount is paid for the option's         time value.\xc2\xa0

价内通话比价外通话更昂贵，但是对于期权的时间价值支付的金额更少。\ xc2 \ xa0
