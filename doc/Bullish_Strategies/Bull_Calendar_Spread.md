# Bull Calendar Spread


# 公牛日历传播
 Using calls, the bull calendar spread strategy can be setup by buying long term        slightly out-of-the-money calls and simultaneously        writing an equal number of near month calls of the same             underlying security with the same strike price.    

使用通话，牛市日历差价策略可以通过购买长期略微价外通话并同时以相同的执行价格写入相同基础证券的近月通话来设置。
        The options trader applying this strategy is bullish for the long term and is selling the near month        calls with the the intention to ride the long term calls for free.

应用这种策略的期权交易者长期看涨，并且出售近月的看涨期权，打算免费获得长期看涨期权。
## Unlimited Upside Profit Potential


## 无限的上行盈利潜力
        Once the near month options expire worthless, this strategy turns into a discounted        long call strategy and so the upside profit potential for the bull calendar spread becomes        unlimited.    

一旦近月期权到期无效，此策略将变为折扣长期看涨策略，因此牛市日历价差的上行盈利潜力变得无限。
## Limited Downside Risk


## 有限的下行风险
The maximum possible loss for the bull calendar spread is limited to the initial debit taken to put on the spread.    This happens when the stock price goes down and stays down until expiration of the    longer term call.

牛市日历价差的最大可能损失限于投放价差的初始借记。
## Example


## 例
        In June, an options trader believes that XYZ stock trading at $40 is going to rise        gradually over the next four months. He enters a bull calendar spread by buying        an OCT 45 out-of-the-money call for $200 and writing a JUL 45 out-of-the-money call for $100. The net investment required        to put on the spread is a debit of $100.

6月份期权交易商认为，XYZ股票40美元的交易价格将在未来四个月内逐步上涨。
        In July, The stock price of XYZ goes up to $42 and the JUL 45 call expires worthless.        Subsequently, the price of XYZ stock rises to $49 in October. The OCT 45 call expires in the money and is worth $400 on expiration. Since the initial debit taken to enter        the trade is $100, his profit comes to $300.

7月份，XYZ的股票价格上涨到42美元，而JUL 45的电话价格到期无效。
        Suppose the price of XYZ did not rise much and remains at or below $45 all the way        until expiration of the long term call in October, the trader will lose the initial        debit of $100 as        both calls expire worthless.

假设XYZ的价格没有上涨并且一直保持在45美元或者低于45美元，直到10月的长期看涨期满，交易者将失去100美元的初始借记，因为这两个看涨期权都没有价值。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the bull calendar spread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注意：虽然我们已参考股票期权涵盖了此策略的使用，但牛市日历差价同样适用于ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Similar Strategies


## 类似的策略
The following strategies are similar to the bull calendar spread in that they are also bullish strategies that have limited profit potential and limited risk.

以下策略类似于牛市日历差价，因为它们也是看涨策略，其利润潜力有限且风险有限。
## Neutral Calendar Spread


## 中性日历传播
        If the options trader is neutral on the underlying stock, he can instead        implement the neutral calendar spread strategy to sell the near        month calls primarily to profit from             time decay.

如果期权交易者对标的股票保持中立，他可以改为实施中性日历差价策略以卖出近月通话，主要是为了从时间衰减中获利。
