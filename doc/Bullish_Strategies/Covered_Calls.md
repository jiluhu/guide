# Covered Calls


# 覆盖的电话
The covered call is a strategy in options trading whereby call options    are written against a holding of the underlying security.

承保的看涨期权是期权交易中的一种策略，其中看涨期权是针对持有基础证券而编写的。
Using the covered call option strategy, the investor gets to earn a premium writing calls while at the same time appreciate all benefits of underlying stock ownership, such as dividends and voting rights, unless he is assigned an exercise notice on the written call and is obligated to sell his shares.

使用涵盖看涨期权策略，投资者可以获得高级写作电话，同时欣赏基础股票所有权的所有好处，例如股息和投票权，除非他在书面电话上被分配了行使通知并且有义务
However, the profit potential of covered call writing is limited as the investor had, in return for the premium, given up the chance to fully profit from a substantial rise in the price of the underlying asset.

然而，由于投资者以溢价作为回报，放弃了从标的资产价格大幅上涨中获利的机会，因此承销看涨期权的利润潜力有限。
## Out-of-the-money Covered Call


## 价外无效的看涨期权
This is a covered call strategy where the moderately bullish investor sells out-of-the-money        calls against a holding of the underlying shares. The OTM covered call is a popular strategy as the investor gets to collect premium while being able to enjoy capital gains (albeit limited) if the underlying stock rallies.

这是一种有保障的看涨期权策略，适度看涨的投资者在持有相关股票的情况下卖出价外看涨期权。 
## Limited Profit Potential


## 有限的利润潜力
In addition to the premium received for writing the call, the OTM covered call strategy's profit also includes a paper gain if the underlying stock price rises, up to the strike price of the call option sold.

除了拨打电话的保费外，OTM承保的通话策略的利润还包括基础股票价格上涨时的纸面收益，直至卖出看涨期权的执行价格。
The formula for calculating maximum profit is given below:

计算最大利润的公式如下：
## Unlimited Loss Potential


## 无限的潜在损失
Potential losses for this strategy can be very large and occurs when the price of the underlying security falls. However, this risk is no different from that which the typical stockowner is exposed to. In fact, the covered call writer's loss is cushioned slightly by the premiums received for writing the calls.

该策略的潜在损失可能非常大，并且在基础证券的价格下跌时发生。
The formula for calculating loss is given below:

计算损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the covered call (otm) position can be calculated using the following formula.

可以使用以下公式计算覆盖呼叫（otm）位置实现收支平衡的低价格。
## Example


## 例
An options trader purchases 100 shares of XYZ stock trading at $50 in June and writes a JUL 55 out-of-the-money call for $2. So he pays $5000 for the 100 shares of XYZ and receives $200 for writing the call option giving a total investment of $4800.

期权交易者在6月份以50美元的价格购买了100股XYZ股票交易，并以2美元的价格收购了JUL 55的价外通话。
On expiration date, the stock had rallied to $57. Since the striking price of $55 for the call option is lower than the current trading price, the call is assigned and the writer sells the shares for a $500 profit. This brings his total profit to $700 after factoring in the $200 in premiums received for writing the call.

到期日，股价已上涨至57美元。
It is interesting to note that the buyer of the call option in this case has a net profit of zero even though the stock had gone up by 7 points.

值得注意的是，在这种情况下，看涨期权的买方的净利润为零，即使股票上涨了7个点。
However, what happens should the stock price had gone down 7 points to $43 instead? Let's take a look.

但是，如果股价下跌7点至43美元，会发生什么呢？
At $43, the call writer will incur a paper loss of $700 for holding the 100 shares of XYZ. However, his loss is offset by the $200 in premiums received so his total loss is $500. In comparison, the call buyer's loss is limited to the premiums paid which is $200.

只需43美元，电话撰稿人将因持有100股XYZ而遭受700美元的纸质损失。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the covered call (otm) is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注：虽然我们已参考股票期权涵盖了此策略的使用，但涵盖的看涨期权（otm）同样适用于ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Summary


## 概要
Overall, writing out-of-the-money covered calls is an excellent strategy to use if you are mildly bullish toward the underlying stock as it allows you to earn a premium which also acts as a cushion should the stock price go down. So if you are planning to hold on to the shares anyway and have a target selling price in mind that is not too far off, you should write a covered call.

总体而言，如果您对基础股票略微看涨，那么写出价外保证金是一种很好的策略，因为它可以让您获得溢价，如果股价下跌，这也会起到缓冲作用。
## Similar Strategies


## 类似的策略
The following strategies are similar to the covered call (otm) in that they are also bullish strategies that have limited profit potential and unlimited risk.

以下策略类似于涵盖的看涨期权（otm），因为它们也是看涨策略，具有有限的盈利潜力和无限风险。
## Collars


## 项圈
As the covered call writer is exposed to substantial downside risk should the stock price of the underlying plunges, collars can be created to reduce this risk thru the use of put options.

由于承保的看涨作者面临巨大的下行风险，如果基础暴跌的股票价格，可以创建项圈以通过使用看跌期权来降低这种风险。
## In-the-money Covered Call Strategy


## 价内有保障的看涨期权策略
In-the-money covered call options are sold when the investor has a neutral to slightly bearish outlook towards the underlying security as their higher premiums provide greater downside protection.

当投资者对基础证券的前景保持中性至略微看跌时，卖出价内期权看涨期权，因为其较高的溢价提供更大的下行保护。
