A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is derived from another entity which is also known as the underlier. The underlier (or underlying) can range from assets such as [commodities](Commodity.md), stocks, real estate, and financial indicators such as stock market indices, interest rates, consumer price index.

衍生工具是一种金融工具，其价值来自另一个实体，也称为底层证券。 底层证券（或潜在的）可以来自商品，股票，房地产等资产，以及股票市场指数，利率，消费者价格指数等金融指标。

Other more exotic derivatives have also been launched in recent years. They include derivatives on weather conditions and carbon emissions. The underlier can also be another derivative. Such a derivative of a derivative would be known as a second generation derivative.

近年来还推出了其他更具异国情调的衍生品。 它们包括天气条件和碳排放的衍生物。 下层也可以是另一种衍生物。 这种衍生物的衍生物将被称为第二代衍生物。

## Uses of Derivatives
## 衍生物的使用
Derivatives can be used by investors to remove (or mitigate) the risk of losses to their holdings that are caused by fluctuations in the value of the underlying. This activity is known as [hedging](Hedging.md). Owing to the high leverage they provide, derivatives can be also used by traders to increase the profit arising if the value of the underlying moves in the direction they expect. This activity is known as speculation.

投资者可以使用衍生工具来消除（或减轻）因基础价值波动而导致其持有的损失风险。 这项活动被称为对冲。 由于它们提供的高杠杆率，交易者也可以使用衍生品来增加当基础价值朝着他们期望的方向移动时产生的利润。 这种活动被称为猜测。
