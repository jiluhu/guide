# Forward Contract
# 远期合约

A forward contract is a financial agreement in which the buyer agrees to pay the seller a predetermined price for a specified quantity of a commodity to be delivered at some point in the future.

远期合同是一种金融协议，其中买方同意向卖方支付预定价格，以便在将来某个时间点交付指定数量的商品。

Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to know in advance the price as well as the date in which they will take or make delivery of the goods. This knowledge enables them to plan ahead and ultimately they can save expenses - cutting down storage costs for instance.

远期合约允许买方和卖方提前知道价格以及他们将采取或交付货物的日期。 这些知识使他们能够提前计划，最终可以节省开支 - 例如降低存储成本。

Forward contracts are privately negotiated, bilateral agreements and the terms of each contract are non-standardized. They are over-the-counter derivatives closely related to futures contracts but they differ in certain aspects.

远期合同是私下谈判的，双边协议和每个合同的条款都是非标准化的。 它们是与期货合约密切相关的场外衍生品，但它们在某些方面存在差异。
