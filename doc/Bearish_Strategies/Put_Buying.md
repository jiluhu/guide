# Long Put


# 长期投入
The long put option strategy is a basic strategy in options trading where the investor buy put options with the belief that the price of the underlying        security will go significantly below the striking price before the             expiration date.

长期看跌期权策略是期权交易中的基本策略，投资者购买认沽期权时认为相关证券的价格将远远低于到期日之前的价格。
## Put Buying vs. Short Selling


## 买入与卖空
Compared to short selling the stock, it is more convenient to bet against a stock by purchasing put options as the investor does not have to borrow the stock to short. Additionally, the risk is capped to the premium paid for the put options, as opposed to unlimited risk when short selling the underlying stock outright.

与卖空股票相比，通过购买看跌期权来买入股票更为方便，因为投资者不必借入股票做空。
However, put options have a limited lifespan. If the underlying stock price does not move below the strike price before the option expiration date, the put option will expire worthless.

但是，看跌期权的寿命有限。
## "Unlimited" Potential


## “无限”的潜力
Since stock price in theory can reach zero at expiration date, the maximum profit possible when using the long put strategy is only limited to the striking price of    the purchased put less the price paid for the option.

由于理论上股票价格在到期日可以达到零，因此使用长期看跌期权策略时可能获得的最大利润仅限于购买的看跌期权的价格减去为期权支付的价格。
The formula for calculating profit is given below:

计算利润的公式如下：
## Limited Risk


## 风险有限
Risk for implementing the long put strategy is limited to the price paid for the put option no matter how high the stock    price is trading on expiration date.

实施长期看跌策略的风险仅限于看跌期权支付的价格，无论股票价格在到期日交易多高。
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

计算最大损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the long put position can be calculated using the following formula.

可以使用以下公式计算长期放置位置实现收支平衡的低价格价格。
## Example


## 例
Suppose the stock of XYZ company is trading at $40. A put option contract with a strike price of $40 expiring in a month's time is being priced at $2. You believe that XYZ stock will fall sharply in the coming weeks and so you paid $200 to purchase a single $40 XYZ put option covering 100 shares.

假设XYZ公司的股票交易价格为40美元。
Say you were proven right and the price of XYZ stock crashes to $30 at option expiration date. With underlying stock price now at $30, your put option will now be in-the-money with an intrinsic value of $1000 and you can sell it for that much. Since you had paid $200 to purchase the put option, your net profit for the entire trade is therefore $800.

假设您被证明是正确的，并且XYZ股票的价格在期权到期日时崩溃至30美元。
However, if you were wrong in your assessement and the stock price had instead rallied to $50, your put option will expire worthless and your total loss will be the $200 that you paid to purchase the option.

但是，如果您的评估错误并且股价反而上涨至50美元，那么您的看跌期权将失效并且您的总损失将是您购买期权所支付的200美元。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the long put is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注：虽然我们已参考股票期权涵盖了此策略的使用，但长期看跌期权同样适用于ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Similar Strategies


## 类似的策略
The following strategies are similar to the long put in that they are also bearish strategies that have unlimited profit potential and limited risk.

以下策略类似于长期投入，因为它们也是具有无限潜在利润和有限风险的看跌策略。
## Out-of-the-money Puts


## 价外投资
Going long on out-of-the-money puts maybe cheaper but the put options have higher risk of expiring        worthless.

长期看跌价可能更便宜，但看跌期权有更高的到期风险毫无价值。
## In-the-money Puts


## 价内投资
In-the-money puts are more expensive than out-of-the-money puts but the amount paid for the time value    of the option is also lower.

价内看跌期权比价外看跌期权更高，但为期权价值支付的金额也更低。
