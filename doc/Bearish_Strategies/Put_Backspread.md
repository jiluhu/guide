# Put Backspread


# 放回延展
The put backspread (reverse put ratio spread) is a bearish strategy in options trading that involves selling a number of put options    and buying more put options    of the same underlying stock and expiration date    at a lower strike price. It is an unlimited profit, limited risk options trading strategy that is taken when    the options trader thinks that the underlying stock will experience significant downside movement in the near term.

止损（反向存放比率差价）是期权交易中的看跌策略，涉及出售多个看跌期权并以较低的执行价格购买相同底层股票和到期日的更多看跌期权。
    A 2:1 put backspread can be implemented by buying a number of puts at a higher strike and buying twice the number of puts at a lower strike.

通过在较高的罢工中购买一些看跌期权并在较低的罢工中买入两倍的看跌期权，可以实施2：1的看跌期权。
## Unlimited Profit Potential


## 无限的利润潜力
        This strategy profits when the stock price makes a strong move to the downside beyond the lower breakeven point. There    is no limit to the maximum possible profit for the put backspread.

当股票价格在下跌盈亏平衡点之外强势下行时，这种策略会获利。
The formula for calculating profit is given below:

计算利润的公式如下：
## Limited Risk


## 风险有限
    Maximum loss for the put backspread is limited and is incurred when the underlying stock price at expiration    is at the strike price of the long puts purchased. At this price, both the long puts expire worthless while the short put expires in the money. Maximum loss is         equal to the intrinsic value        of the short put plus or minus any debit or credit taken when putting on the spread.

止损的最大损失是有限的，并且当到期的标的股票价格为所购买的长期看跌期权的执行价格时产生。
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

计算最大损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
There are 2 break-even points for the put backspread position. The breakeven points can be calculated using the following formulae.

推杆后退位置有2个收支平衡点。
## Example


## 例
    Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $48 in June. An options trader executes a 2:1 put    backspread by selling a JUL 50 put for $400 and buying two JUL 45 puts for $200 each. The net debit/credit taken to enter the trade is zero.

假设XYZ股票6月交易价格为48美元。
        On expiration in July, if XYZ stock is trading at $45, both the JUL 45 puts expire        worthless while the short JUL 50 put expires in the money with $500 in intrinsic        value. Buying back this put to close the position will result in the maximum loss        of $500 for the options trader.

在7月到期时，如果XYZ股票的交易价格为45美元，那么JUL 45的到期价格都将毫无价值，而JUL 50的期权到期则会以500美元的内在价值到期。
        If XYZ stock drops to $40 on expiration in July, all the options will expire in        the money. The short JUL 50 put is worth $1000 and needs to be bought        back to close the position. Since the two JUL 45 puts bought is now worth $500 each,        their combined value of $1000 is just enough to offset the losses from the written put. Therefore,        he achieves breakeven at $40.    

如果XYZ股票在7月到期时跌至40美元，那么所有期权都将在到期时到期。
        Below $40 though, there will be no limit to the gains possible. For example, at        $30, each long JUL 45 put will be worth $1500 while his single short JUL 50 put        is only worth $2000, resulting in a profit of $1000.    

虽然低于40美元，但可能获得的收益没有限制。
        If the stock price had rallied to $50 or higher at expiration, all the options involved will expire worthless. Since        the net debit to put on this trade is zero, there is no resulting loss.

如果股票价格在到期时涨至50美元或更高，所有相关的期权都将失效。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the put backspread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注意：尽管我们已经参考股票期权涵盖了该策略的使用，但是使用ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权，投资延迟同样适用。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Similar Strategies


## 类似的策略
The following strategies are similar to the put backspread in that they are also bearish strategies that have unlimited profit potential and limited risk.

以下策略类似于延迟回补，因为它们也是看跌策略，具有无限的盈利潜力和有限的风险。
## Ratio Spread


## 比率差价
The converse strategy to the backspread is the ratio spread.         Ratio spreads    are used when little movement is expected of    the underlying stock price.

延迟的逆向策略是比率差价。
## Call Backspread


## 致电Backspread
The backspread can also be constructed using calls. Unlike the put backspread,    the     call backspread is a bullish strategy.
