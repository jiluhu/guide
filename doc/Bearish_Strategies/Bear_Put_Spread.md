# Bear Put Spread


# 熊投入差价
The bear put spread option trading strategy is employed when the options trader thinks that the price of the underlying asset will go down moderately in the near term.

当期权交易者认为相关资产的价格在短期内会适度下跌时，采用看跌期权交易策略。
Bear put spreads can be implemented by buying a higher striking in-the-money put option and selling a lower striking out-of-the-money put option of the same underlying security with the same expiration date.

熊市点差可以通过购买更高价的看跌期权看跌期权并在相同的到期日卖出相同基础证券的低价卖出看跌期权来实现。
By shorting the out-of-the-money put, the options trader reduces the cost of establishing the bearish position but    forgoes the chance of making a large profit in the event that the underlying asset    price plummets. The bear put spread options strategy is also know as the bear put debit spread as a debit is taken    upon entering the trade.

通过卖空价外，期权交易者降低了建立看跌头寸的成本，但放弃了在相关资产价格暴跌的情况下赚取大量利润的机会。
## Limited Downside Profit


## 有限的下行利润
To reach maximum profit, the stock price need to close below the             strike price of the out-of-the-money puts on the expiration date. Both options expire in the money but the higher strike put that was purchased will have higher         intrinsic value than the lower strike put that was sold. Thus, maximum profit for the bear put spread option strategy is equal to the difference in strike price minus the debit taken when the position was entered.

为了达到最大利润，股票价格需要在到期日收盘价低于价外卖出的执行价格。
The formula for calculating maximum profit is given below:

计算最大利润的公式如下：
## Limited Upside Risk


## 有限的上行风险
If the stock price rise above the in-the-money put option strike price at the expiration date, then the bear put spread strategy suffers a maximum loss equal to the debit taken when putting on the trade.

如果股票价格在到期日上涨至价内看跌期权执行价格之上，那么熊市利差扩散策略的最大损失将等于交易时所用的借方。
The formula for calculating maximum loss is given below:

计算最大损失的公式如下：
## Breakeven Point(s)


## 盈亏平衡点
The underlier price at which break-even is achieved for the bear put spread position can be calculated using the following formula.

可以使用以下公式计算对于熊市扩散头寸实现收支平衡的低价格价格。
## Bear Put Spread Example


## Bear Put Spread示例
    Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $38 in June. An options trader bearish on XYZ decides    to enter a bear put spread position by buying a JUL 40 put for $300 and sell a JUL    35 put for $100 at the same time, resulting in a net debit of $200 for entering this    position.

假设XYZ股票6月交易价格为38美元。
        The price of XYZ stock subsequently drops to $34 at expiration. Both puts expire        in-the-money with the JUL 40 call bought having $600 in intrinsic value and the JUL        35 call sold having $100 in intrinsic value. The spread would then have a net value        of $5 (the difference in strike price). Deducting the debit taken when he placed        the trade, his net profit is $300. This is also his maximum possible profit.

XYZ股票的价格随后在到期时降至34美元。
        If the stock had rallied to $42 instead, both options expire worthless, and the        options trader loses the entire debit of $200 taken to enter the trade. This is also        the maximum possible loss.

如果该股票反弹至42美元，则两种期权均无效，期权交易者将失去200美元的全部借记资金进入交易。
Note: While we have covered the use of this strategy with reference to stock options, the bear put spread is equally applicable using ETF options, index options as well as options on futures.

注：虽然我们已参考股票期权涵盖了此策略的使用，但熊市利差在使用ETF期权，指数期权以及期货期权时同样适用。
## Commissions


## 委员会
For ease of understanding, the calculations depicted in the above examples did not take into account commission charges as they are relatively small amounts (typically around $10 to $20) and varies across option brokerages.

为了便于理解，上述示例中描述的计算没有考虑佣金费用，因为它们的金额相对较小（通常在10美元到20美元左右），并且在期权经纪公司中有所不同。
However, for active traders, commissions can eat up a sizable portion of their profits in the long run. If you trade options actively, it is wise to look for a low commissions broker. Traders who trade large number of contracts in each trade should check out OptionsHouse.com as they offer a low fee of only $0.15 per contract (+$4.95 per trade).

然而，对于活跃的交易者而言，从长远来看，佣金可以占用相当大一部分的利润。
## Bear Spread on a Credit


## 熊传播信用
        The bear put spread is a debit spread as the difference between the sale and purchase of the two options results in a net debit. For a bearish spread position that is entered with a net credit, see bear call spread.

熊市差价是借记差价，因为两种期权的买卖之间的差异导致净借记。
